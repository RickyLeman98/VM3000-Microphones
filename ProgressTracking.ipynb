In light of this, it was necessary to explore whether there was sufficient clockspace on the RPi Zero W to dedicate to the VM3000 microphone without impeding other function. The RPi Zero W contains a BCM2835 chip which runs at 1 GHz so plenty of clockrate can be dedicated to the VM3000.

    "The board is powered using a rechargeable Li-Ion 18650 battery which will be electrically connected to the board and mechanically fixed using 18650 battery contact clips. The 18650 outputs an average of 3.7V, however the Raspberry Pi Zero W is powered using 5V, therefore a DC/DC boost converter is required. The TPS81256 and a 4.7uF decoupling capacitor as recommended by the component datasheet is used to output a fixed 5V output to the RPi from the 3.7V 18650 battery input. An SPST toggle switch is used to power up or power down the board as required without needing to physically remove the battery for ease of use and battery life preservation. Thicker traces are used to accomodate for current output from the 18650 battery through to the SPST toggle switch. The 5V output from the TPS81256 is fed into the 5V power input pin of the RPi (pin 2), which will be connected to the PCB using a female/male header pair (female header will be soldered onto the PCB and male header onto the RPi). Polygon pours have been used for the TPS81256 as per SME recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3.3V output of the RPi (pin 1) is then used to power the VM3000 microphone pair; each VM3000 has an accompanying 0.1uF capacitor to reduce ringing upon power up. For stereo audio, the L/R select of each microphone is appropriately set following the VM3000 datasheet. Both VM3000 are driven using the same clock-line from pin 12. PDM data output from VM3000 is received using a single line which is connected to pin 38 of the RPi. A 2mA LED is connected to the power line in series with a 330 Ohm resistor as a low-power visual indicator of when the board is in operation. Several test pads are strategically placed on the board for troubleshooting purposes. Copper pours are used on both top and bottom layers of the board for ground connection. 4x 3mm holes are drilled on the edges of the board for mechanical fixing purposes, and 4x 2.75mm holes are drilled to accomodate for mechanical fixing of the RPi using spacer screws if the mechanical strength of female/male headers is deemed inadequate.\n",

    "<b> Some issues identified </b>\n",

    "There were 3 issues identified once the board had arrived which will be important for future iterations of this prototype:\n",
    " - Not enough spacing between the Pi Zero W and the battery holder clip. The protruding length of the SD card was not acccounted for, therefore in future iterations ensure adequate spacing inbetween the battery and Pi Zero W.\n",
    " - Silkscreen for component labels were not printed on this board. This is likely to have been an error on my part when generating the gerber files.\n",
    " - For future design, since there is plenty of empty space on the board, aim to use components with larger footprints for ease of soldering - notice how the resistor and capacitor footprints are quite small despite plenty of space surrounding it."

    "Since some of the component footprints on the PCB is extremely small, a stencil was also ordered as part of the PCB order from Elecrow to assist in soldering components onto the board. The TPS81256 DCDC Boost Converter, VM3000 microphones, capacitors, resistor and LED will be soldered using a stencil, PCB paste and heated using the heat gun available in the UWA SHL. The remaining components are Through Hole Technology and can therefore be hand-soldered. Guides on solder paste and THT soldering best practice can be found online.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Challenges faced </b>\n",
    " - First time use of stencil and solder paste; some components were not heated adequately and when testing whether they were soldered on by bumping with a tweaser, they were displaced from their footprint. Putting them back in place caused smudging of solder paste which had the potential to create shorts. \n",
    " - A single component was shorted (0.1 uF capacitor closest to GPIO header pins) which produced a closed loop connection that fried the battery output trace of the board. This can be seen in subsequent images where the burnt trace has been rebuilt using solder.\n",
    " - Unknown behaviour of TPS81256 Boost Converter; the TPS81256 was initially outputting a stable 5V using the 18650 4V input, however at a certain stage it began to 3.7V and was unable to power the RPi, yet after being left untouched for 30 minutes it then returned to outputting a stable 5V. The root cause of this behaviour is not yet known however it may have been a loading issue. \n",
    " \n",
    "In troubleshooting the board for shorts, faulty connections and confirming voltage/current levels, a multimeter was used. There is a short connection testing functionality which was used to ensure no components were shorted together and therefore would not damage the board when powered - in hindsight, this step should have been done prior to powering the board the first time around. The voltage measurement setting on the multimeter was also very useful in checking the voltage output of the battery, the switch, the TPS81256 and the RPi 3.3V pin.\n",

    "The images below show the microphone array prototype board populated with all relevant components, with and without the 18650 Li-Ion battery and RPi Zero W installed. Notice how in the last 2 images both the green LED (powered by the RPi 3.3V output) and the green LED on the RPi itself lights up - this indicated the 18650 is sufficiently powering the RPi through its start-up sequence and into operation.
