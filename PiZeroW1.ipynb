    "As discussed with Ben and Melinda during one of my earlier meetings for thesis, sourcing the Raspberry Pi Zero W proved to be one of the initial hurdles of this project. Not only is the Pi Zero W often out of stock, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has limited the sale of one Pi Zero W per customer which makes it all the more difficult to source a stockpile of these boards for testing purposes. \n",

    "I conducted a vendor screening on the 17/07/2020 - the Excel file has been uploaded onto SHL teams. Most local vendors out of stock, the remaining vendors were either overseas or sold the Pi Zero W's at unreasonably inflated prices. Luckily I was able to source a Pi Zero W from a friend of mine who had a spare on hand."
